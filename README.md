## Idea in One Line ##


The idea is very simple that a user needs to create 50words challenge to start using website. 

## Detailed ##
The challenge can be 7days, 30 days, 90 days, 180days, or 365 days. Once challenge is accepted user start writing what was the most inspiring thing happened during the day. It can be anything -- a good article read, a good video or movie watched etc. If a user miss any day then he is out and can create a new challenge and that challenge will be lost. At most user can create one 50word for a day for a given challenge . You can't write before hand. You can share this with outside world or keep it private or share within your group. Once the challenge is completed, user will get a book for his/her journey. Again user can publish book to outside world or contact publisher for his/her book.
